# SMA-Crossover-

This algorithm is a Simple Moving Average Algorithm. What it does is averages price over a specified period. For this example, I used Apple ("AAPL") to test the algorithm. 

The SMA is only used for educational purposes, as a benchmark to learning about Quantitative Trading & Research.
